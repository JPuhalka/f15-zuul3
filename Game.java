/**
 *  This class is the main class of the "Escape with Dignity" application. 
 *  "Escape with Dignity" is a text based adventure game where you play as a scoundrel who has
 *  woken up naked and hung over in a dirty horse stall in the stables of a castle.  You must get your clothes
 *  and the key to the main gate of the castle so you can escape!
 * 
 *  To play this game, create an instance of this class and call the "play"
 *  method.
 * 
 *  This main class creates and initialises all the others: it creates all
 *  rooms, creates the parser and starts the game.  It also evaluates and
 *  executes the commands that the parser returns.
